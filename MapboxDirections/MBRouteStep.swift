/**
 A `RouteStep` object represents a single distinct maneuver along a route and the approach to the next maneuver. The route step object corresponds to a single instruction the user must follow to complete a portion of the route. For example, a step might require the user to turn then follow a road.
 
 You do not create instances of this class directly. Instead, you receive route step objects as part of route objects when you request directions using the `Directions.calculate(_:completionHandler:)` method, setting the `includesSteps` option to `true` in the `RouteOptions` object that you pass into that method.
